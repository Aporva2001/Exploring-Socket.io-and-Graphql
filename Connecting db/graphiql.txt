# # Welcome to GraphiQL
# #
# # GraphiQL is an in-browser tool for writing, validating, and
# # testing GraphQL queries.
# #
# # Type queries into this side of the screen, and you will see intelligent
# # typeaheads aware of the current GraphQL type schema and live syntax and
# # validation errors highlighted within the text.
# #
# # GraphQL queries typically start with a "{" character. Lines that start
# # with a # are ignored.
# #
# # An example GraphQL query might look like:
# #
# #     {
# #       field(arg: "value") {
# #         subField
# #       }
# #     }
# #

# #  Prettify Query:  Shift-Ctrl-P (or press the prettify button above)
# #
# #     Merge Query:  Shift-Ctrl-M (or press the merge button above)
# #
# #       Run Query:  Ctrl-Enter (or press the play button above)
